However, the data shows that casuals are much more affected by cold weather, in the sense that during most winter months, casuals only complete about 20% of the total rides (which means that members are responsible for 80% of the rides), while when temperatures are high, almost 40-50% of the rides are done by casuals. Therefore, casuals' behaviour changes more drastically with the month, as opposed to some members who want to take advantage of their membership no matter how cold it is outside.",(0,s.jsx)("br",{}),"Looking at the average ride times by day of the week, we can see that casuals ride longer on weekends, although members also tend to ride longer on weekends, but they only ride 1 or 2 minutes longer than on weekdays. This trend is much clearer in the average number of rides chart, where casuals ride much more on weekends than on weekdays, and members' rides are more evenly distributed throughout the week. In addition, during the warmer months (in this case, June, July, August and September), casuals ride even more on weekends than members.
